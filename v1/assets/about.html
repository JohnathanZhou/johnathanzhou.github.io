            <h4><strong>About</strong> Me</h4>
            <p class="lead">I'm a second-year at UC Berkeley studying Computer Science and Education.</p>
            <p> I'm an experienced developer and marketer with a deep interest in the intersection of tech and social good. 
                More specifically, my interests lie in education technology and its applications in tackling difficult issues in 
                societal learning. I hope to work in this field as a product manager in the future!
            </p>
            <p>
                In my free time, I enjoy browsing and trying out new products on <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/@johnathanz">Product Hunt</a>,
                honing my photography skills, and reading about self development. You can also catch me playing Hearthstone for UC Berkeley's collegiate
                team and playing basketball/table tennis.
